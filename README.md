# Julia Hughes
# Hi, I'm Julia Hughes, a 3rd-year Biomedical Engineering student at UWaterloo.

# This repository highlights my experience in biomedical data and signal processing, spanning Python, MATLAB, and C++. From EMG-controlled prosthetics to ultrasound beamforming and ergonomic design optimization, I’ve developed data-driven, systems-level insights—skills that directly align with analyzing complex genomic data. My focus on reproducible workflows and creative analysis will help me contribute to genomic-scale projects
